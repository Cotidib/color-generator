# color-generator
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Color Generator project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and Learnings

Main React functionalities I learned: handling exceptions, inline css, dynamic styling and a copy to clipboard functionality. 
I made my own setup, styling and added a night mode switch feature using Styled Components to the original idea of the project.
